# Unity-Engine-Graphics-Project
The challenge was to use Unity to create a graphical simulation of an alien planet surface. 
The planet could be of any type â€“ rock, ice, lava, city, forest, desert, lagoon, etc. 
During this coursework I wrote many shaders for features such as fog and bloom. I experimented with multiple aspects of the Unity editor, using textures, materials, and shader graphs in creating features such as the water.
A simple platformer game, one of my first Unity games.
